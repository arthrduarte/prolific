## Step-by-Step Plan to Transition from React Native to React (Web)

Below is a high-level strategy for migrating your existing React Native (Expo) mobile application to a React-based web application. Since you’ll be moving from native mobile UIs to the browser, you’ll need to adapt component libraries, navigation, and many device-specific or platform-specific features. This plan outlines the necessary steps and considerations.

---

### 1. Create a New React Web Project
1. Use a React starter (like Create React App, Vite, Next.js, or similar) to bootstrap a new project.  
2. Set up your project structure in a way that mirrors your current “feature-based” folder structure.  
3. Install necessary dependencies (e.g., react, react-dom, supabase-js, etc.).

Example (with Create React App):
bash
npx create-react-app my-web-app
cd my-web-app
npm install @supabase/supabase-js


---

### 2. Extract Shared Logic and Services
1. Identify code that does not depend on react-native or Expo features (e.g., querying Supabase, local utility/helper functions).  
2. Move these pieces into a shared “core” or “services” folder within your new web project.  
3. Configure your Supabase client similarly, since your supabase.ts logic can remain mostly the same.

Example of shared code in a file (shared/lib/supabase.ts):
typescript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
const supabaseUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL;
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;
export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);


---

### 3. Replace React Native Components with Web Equivalents
1. For layout and styling, use standard HTML elements and CSS or a React styling solution (CSS Modules, styled-components, etc.).  
2. Replace React Native’s <View>, <Text>, <TouchableOpacity> with <div>, <p>/<span>/<h1>, and <button>/<div> as appropriate.  
3. Any usage of react-native-safe-area-context, react-native-gesture-handler, or platform-specific libraries should be removed or replaced with standard web solutions.

Example replacement patterns:
- “SafeAreaView” → a <div> or <header> with appropriate CSS padding/margins.  
- “TouchableOpacity” → a <button> or <div onClick={} >.  
- “StyleSheet.create()” → a standard .css file or styled-components.

---

### 4. Adapt Navigation for the Web
1. React Navigation (mobile) does not directly apply to web.  
2. Use a router library like React Router (v6+).  
3. Recreate your screens as routes in React Router.  
4. Convert stack navigators to route paths (e.g., /home, /course/:courseId, /exercise/:exerciseId, etc.).  

Example route setup (using React Router v6+):
tsx
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './pages/Home';
import Course from './pages/Course';
import Exercise from './pages/Exercise';
function AppRouter() {
return (
<BrowserRouter>
<Routes>
<Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
<Route path="/course/:courseId" element={<Course />} />
<Route path="/exercise/:exerciseId" element={<Exercise />} />
</Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
);
}
export default AppRouter;


---

### 5. Migrate or Rebuild UI Screens
Follow a consistent pattern for each “screen” (now a page/route):
1. Create a new component in the React web app (e.g., pages/Home.tsx).  
2. Copy over your logic from the corresponding react-native screen.  
3. Replace any react-native-specific components with suitable web components (e.g., <div>, <button>, etc.).  
4. Migrate state management (hooks) basically as-is, since React hook usage is similar in both React Native and React web.  

Example rename:
- src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx → src/pages/Home.tsx
- src/screens/CourseScreen.tsx → src/pages/Course.tsx
- src/screens/ExerciseScreen.tsx → src/pages/Exercise.tsx

---

### 6. Setup Auth Flow in the Web
1. You can continue using Supabase for authentication.  
2. If you used deep links or expo-auth-session for mobile OAuth, switch to standard web-based OAuth with Supabase.  
3. This often involves redirecting the user to the provider’s OAuth page, and Supabase handles returns to your domain.

---

### 7. Handle Platform-Specific APIs
1. Remove or replace native modules that only exist in react-native (camera, microphone, accelerometer, etc.) with web counterparts (Media APIs, navigator requests, etc.), if needed.  
2. For instance, expo-linking is replaced by standard window.location or React Router navigation.  
3. Some expo libraries might have web equivalents, but verify each dependency is compatible in the browser.

---

### 8. Redesign or Adjust Styling for Browsers
1. Decide on a styling approach—CSS Modules, styled-components, or frameworks like Tailwind CSS.  
2. Update any dimension-based styling (like flex or absolute positioning from react-native) to flexible CSS styling.  
3. Watch out for differences in layout, e.g., your new web app might need a responsive design for desktop or mobile screens.

---

### 9. Remove React Native/Expo Dependencies
1. Remove or ignore any dependencies that are purely for React Native.  
2. You may want to keep “@supabase/supabase-js” and “react” obviously.  
3. In your web project, ensure your package.json has only relevant web packages.  

---

### 10. Test and Refine
1. Start your React web app locally, test navigation, supabase auth, and all major features.  
2. Ensure new routing matches user flows from the original app.  
3. Refactor any UI or logic that doesn’t feel native to the web user experience (for example, track “scroll” events instead of “swipe,” etc.).

---

### 11. Deploy
1. Choose your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.).  
2. Configure environment variables for your Supabase URL, Supabase public anon key, etc.  
3. Deploy your web app.  
4. Verify that your production domain works with your Supabase OAuth (if configured).

---

## Summary
Transforming a React Native app to a React web application requires replacing platform-specific components with web equivalents, reworking navigation, and rethinking styling and user interactions to fit the browser model. The core logic for Supabase queries and shared hooks can largely remain unchanged, but anything referencing react-native or expo must be methodically replaced with standard web or React solutions.

This plan should position you to begin incrementally porting your code, starting with a new project scaffold, migrating shared logic, and creating or refactoring your “screens” for the browser. Over time, you’ll have a fully functioning web application that shares much of the same business logic as your mobile app.
